// A friend class can access private and protected members of other classes in which it is declared as a friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private and protected members of other classes.
// Like a friend class, a friend function can be granted special access to private and protected members of a class in C++. They are not the member functions of the class but can access and manipulate the private and protected members of that class for they are declared as friends.
